# SuperStore_Tableau

Using the sample superstore data set, find out if the discounted products are more profitable than the no discount ones.

For this:

Create a sheet to understand the relationship between profit ratio and discount percentage.
Create another sheet where weâ€™ ll look at discount %, discount $, profit and profit ratio in conjunction to see if there is a trend.
Next, look at the same parameters for each sub-category to see if we can pinpoint a particular sub-category.
Also, it might be useful to look at discount and profit ratio for each sub category to understand the relation, in another worksheet.
Add each of these findings to a dashboard. 
In the first dashboard, drag the discounted vs un discounted sales by category sheet
For the next dashboard , let's drag breakdown by subcategory and profit vs discount sheets to a new dashboard and add text to summarize.
The next dashboard is profit vs discounted category.
Create stories using all the information.
